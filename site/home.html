<h3>1. Listening to music:</h3>
                                                    
<p>I am someone who really enjoys listening to music, <br/>
                                                        
especially because it helps me express and understand <br/>
                                                            
my emotions. Whenever I am not in the mood or feeling low, <br/>
                                                                
I listen to music to boost me up and make me feel more positive. <br/>
                                                                    
Music helps me relax, clear my mind, and escape from stress for a while. <br/>
                                                                        
No matter what I am doing, listening to my favorite songs <br/>
                                                                            
makes everything more enjoyable and keeps me feeling motivated and calm.</p>

<h3>2. Watching movies:</h3>

<p>
    
  I also really enjoy watching movies because they help me relax <br/>
        
  and take my mind off things. Whenever I feel bored, stressed, <br/>
            
  or not in the mood, watching a movie helps me feel better and lifts my spirits. <br/>
                
  Movies allow me to escape into different stories and characters, <br/>
                    
  making me forget about my worries for a while. Whether it's an exciting, funny, <br/>
                        
  or emotional movie, watching films always helps me unwind and enjoy my free time.
